Autotools Build and Install:

    The normal install is meant for for those who do not want to install a lot
    of extra developer packages, and want to use the standard "configure"
    steps.  These steps build the most common version of Seq66, "qseq66" with
    the internal "rtmidi" engine.  The "configure" script for the build
    process means one needs to install the various "dev" dependencies.  The
    conventional way to install applications from source code is to use the
    source tarball and run the normal mantra:

        $ ./bootstrap
        $ ./configure
        $ make
        $ sudo make install

Debugging:

    Normally, one can bootstrap or configure with the --enable-debug option.
    However, on some machines (e.g. Debian Sid running gcc 9), the debug build
    fails because it cannot find one of the library symbols.  In that case,
    one can either use a qmake debug build or the following sequence of
    commands:

        $ ./bootstrap
        $ ./configure --enable-debug    [note the lack of "--disable-shared"]
        $ make &> make.log              [verify that there are no errors]
        $ libtool --mode=execute gdb ./Seq66qt5/qseq66

    We use cgdb instead of gdb for debugging.
